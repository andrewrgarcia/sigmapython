# statistics
Statistics with python. Goal is to replace the R statistical software (ha just kidding).

Fitting capabilities open to the people.

pdsfit.py - probability distribution fitting: basically find a good distribution for your histograms.

minfit.py - it's a simple nonlinear fit (as in those usually performed through Excel) through an error minimization algorithm.
